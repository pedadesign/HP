bio: I am currently a PhD candidate in Second Language Studies at University of
  Hawaiʻi at Mānoa studying how conversations help (second) language acquisition
  and development. I wear several hats through my professional journey, but they
  are closely related. I am a researcher, an educator, a specialist and a
  designer. I started as a language teacher, then teacher educator working with
  both pre-service and in-service teachers. I was awarded the Fulbright
  scholarship to pursue the master degree specializing in language assessment,
  measurement, and program evaluation (2014-2016). I am also a self-taught
  designer, thereby an advocate of design thinking in problem solving at
  individual, institutional and social levels. Below are some questions that
  guide me through my intellectual and professional journey.
